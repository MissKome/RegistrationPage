Boundary Value Analysis:

Boundary value analysis focuses on testing values at the boundaries of input partitions. 
For the "Age" field, you can apply boundary value analysis like this:

Age:
Boundary 1: Just below the lower boundary (e.g., age = 17)
Boundary 2: Lower boundary (e.g., age = 18)
Boundary 3: Within the valid range (e.g., age = 25)
Boundary 4: Upper boundary (e.g., age = 64)
Boundary 5: Just above the upper boundary (e.g., age = 65)
