Equivalence Partitioning:

Equivalence partitioning divides the input domain into classes or partitions, and you design test cases for each partition. 
For your registration form, here are the partitions for each field:

Username:
Partition 1: Valid usernames (e.g., "JohnDoe")
Partition 2: Invalid usernames (e.g., "J")
Partition 3: Special characters in usernames (e.g., "User@123")

Email:
Partition 1: Valid email addresses (e.g., "user@example.com")
Partition 2: Invalid email formats (e.g., "invalidemail" or "user@com")
Partition 3: Special characters in email addresses (e.g., "user@ex!ample.com")

Password:
Partition 1: Valid passwords meeting criteria (e.g., "StrongPassword123")
Partition 2: Weak passwords (e.g., "123456")
Partition 3: Passwords with special characters (e.g., "P@ssw0rd")

Age:
Partition 1: Valid ages (e.g., 18 to 64)
Partition 2: Underage (e.g., 15)
